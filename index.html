    <h1> Boycott, Divest and Saction (BDS) Report for Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU)</h1>
    <br>
    <p>With this report, we, the students of Heinrich-Heine-University
        Düsseldorf (HHU), call upon our university administration to implement
        <strong>Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)</strong> against Israeli
        academic institutions, particularly in light of HHU’s close ties with
        Reichman University in Herzliya.<br />
        We urge HHU to suspend all collaborations with Israeli academic
        institutions and to conduct a critical investigation into these
        partnerships, as such institutions play a key role in sustaining
        Israel’s occupation in a modernized and institutionalized form.
    </p>
    <p>Israeli institutions of higher education “have played a key role in
        planning, implementing and justifying Israel’s occupation and apartheid
        policies.” (1)</p>
    <p>Therefore, HHU bears the responsibility to suspend these
        collaborations and to take a critical stance against the academic
        institutional support for Israel’s ongoing violations of international
        law and human rights. These violations include the systematic targeting
        of civilian populations, the destruction of civilian institutions, the
        obstruction of medical aid, and the forced displacement of Palestinian
        communities — acts which continue to threaten countless lives.</p>
    <p>According to the <strong>United Nations Convention on the Prevention
            and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</strong>, genocide is defined
        as:</p>
    <p>“Any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole
        or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as
        such:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Killing members of the group;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated
            to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”
            (2)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These criteria clearly correspond to the actions of the Israeli
        government, whose policies of displacement, systematic violence, and
        denial of fundamental rights to the Palestinian population have been
        ongoing since before the foundation of the state in 1948.<br />
        Since October 7th, 2023, Israel has, by definition, committed genocide
        against the Palestinian people. Current reports document over
        <strong>71,391 deaths</strong>, <strong>171,279 injuries</strong>,
        approximately <strong>90,000 malnourished children</strong>, <strong>1.6
            million people</strong> in Gaza facing acute food insecurity,
        <strong>81% of all structures destroyed or damaged</strong>, and the
        killing of more than <strong>18,863 school students</strong>, among
        countless other atrocities. (3)
    </p>
    <p>Israeli academic institutions maintain direct ties to the Israeli
        government and military. Programs such as <strong>Erez</strong>, in
        which “military and academic training are intertwined” and students are
        transformed “from civilians to elite fighters,” (4) and military
        doctrines such as the <strong>Dahiya Doctrine</strong>, which explicitly
        promote large-scale destruction of civilian infrastructure (5),
        demonstrate that these institutions are deeply embedded in the machinery
        of occupation and warfare.</p>
    <p>HHU must therefore act in accordance with international law and human
        rights and terminate all academic ties with Israeli universities and
        institutions.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS)</strong> movement is
        a Palestinian-led global movement advocating for freedom, justice and
        equality. Inspired by the South African anti-apartheid struggle, BDS
        seeks to pressure Israel to comply with international law and uphold
        fundamental human rights. Since its launch in 2005, BDS has grown into a
        worldwide movement with significant impact, including numerous academic
        institutions that have suspended or reviewed ties with Israeli partners.
        (6)(8)</p>
    <p>Moreover, Israel systematically denies Palestinian students access to
        higher education and repeatedly targets Palestinian universities and
        academic institutions, revealing the selective and political nature of
        its proclaimed commitment to “academic freedom.” (7)</p>
    <p>For these reasons, it is of critical importance that academic
        institutions worldwide participate in the isolation of Israeli academia
        as a means of preventing further violations and upholding ethical
        responsibility.</p>
    <p>This report critically examines HHU’s collaborations with Israeli
        academic institutions, including exchange programs, joint research
        projects, and institutional partnerships, and analyzes their political,
        ethical, and legal implications in light of Israel’s ongoing violations
        of international law and human rights.</p>
    <p>It further documents HHU’s increasingly restrictive and repressive
        conduct toward students and academic staff regarding engagement with the
        topic of Palestine, including the banning of events, obstruction of
        campus initiatives, enforced modification of student-organized
        activities, prevention of public discussions, and administrative
        suppression of student groups. Such practices directly contradict the
        university’s stated commitment to academic freedom, open discourse, and
        democratic participation.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the report highlights the university’s selective and
        inconsistent application of ethical standards, particularly when
        contrasted with its immediate termination of collaborations with Russian
        institutions following the invasion of Ukraine. This disparity raises
        serious concerns about HHU’s institutional integrity and commitment to
        universal human rights principles.</p>
    <p>Together, these issues demonstrate that HHU’s current policies do not
        reflect institutional neutrality but rather constitute active political
        positioning that contributes to the normalization of systemic
        injustice.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, we call upon HHU and its administration to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>End all collaborations that contradict international law;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Terminate partnerships with Israeli academic institutions;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Promote awareness of the ongoing genocide in Gaza;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Guarantee freedom of expression and assembly on campus;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Boycott activities connected to the Israeli government;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinian people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We further call upon our fellow students to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Refuse participation in such collaborations;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Speak out against genocide and injustice;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Actively demand ethical conduct from the university administration
            in accordance with human rights principles.</li>

    <p>This project includes the Hadassah Medical Organization. Hadassah,
        the Women’s Zionist Organization of America has voiced outspoken support
        of Israel’s position in the attack on Gaza. The founder of Hadassah
        Henrietta Szold was key in overturning the United Nations General
        Assembly Resolution 3379 which described Zionism as racism. The
        organization has also set up the School of Military Medicine in Israel
        where they train students for the Medical Corps of the

    <p>GLIOMATCH is a Horizon research project including the HHU and the
        Israel Rambam Hospital. The Rambam Teaching Hospital is “the designated
        healthcare provider for the IDF Northern Command” and is thus intimately
        involved in the training of IDF reservists. While it is not a military
        hospital (as these do not exist in Israel), “Rambam is about as close to
        that as possible”, since it works closely with the Home Front Command
        (the national guard) in addition to the occupational forces of the
        IDF.</p>

    <h2 id="tel-aviv">Tel Aviv University (TAU) </h2>
    <p>Fehlt noch wie genau TAU mit HHU verbunden ist </p>
    <p>Tel Aviv University (TAU) has close ties with both the Israeli
        Defense Force (IDF) and the Israeli Military- Industrial Complex.</p>
    <p>It hosts the Institute for national security policy (INSS) [^1]which
        aims to influence “Israel’s long-term national security policy”[^2] . As
        a think tank and a research institute It influences Israeli public
        opinion in both geopolitical and security policy. It developed the
        “Dahiya Doctrine” calling for massive disproportionate force and
        deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure. Richard
        Falk, a professor emeritus of international law at princeton university
        has called it “overt violation of the most elementary norms of the law
        of war and of universal morality”[^3]. An investigation by the
        University of Washington’s Department of Global Health has condemned it,
        as it “intentionally violates international humanitarian law”[^4].</p>
    <p>In addition to hosting the INSS, TAU works directly with the IDF as
        part of the Erez Program. Which trains IDF cadets to serve as commanders
        on the TAU campus. Part of the Erez Program includes a bachelors at the
        TAU[^5]. It aims that participants have “a diverse skill set acquired
        during their combat service, coupled with a bachelor’s degree and
        command experience.” [^5] . Students of TAU have condemned it as turning
        “campus into an army base”[^6].</p>
    <p>TAU also funds a private venture capital firm “TAU Ventures”[^7].
        Which among others provides funding for XTEND, an Israeli arms
        development company, which specializes in “AI-assisted tactical
        robotics” [^8]. XTEND works closely together with the IDF and is heavily
        involved in the Gaza Genocide. Aviv Shapira, the CEO of XTEND has called
        TAU Ventures “the home for the XTEND team, giving us the space, support,
        funding”[^7] .</p>
    <p>TAUs close links to the IDF extend to the Elrom Center, a joint
        center with the IDF air force, which researches into the ” development
        and adaptation of the Air Force’s operational concepts, combat
        doctrines, and power- building processes.” [^10]. According to IAF
        Commander Norkin the explicit goal is “to ensure the position of the IAF
        as one of the leading forces in the world”, in keeping with the vision
        of first prime minister of Israel and of the Nakba Ben Gurion: “the air
        is a new kingdom we must conquer” [^11]</p>

    <h2 id="reichmann-university">Reichmann University Herzliya</h2>
    <p>Over one third of the student’s body of the Reichmann University
        comes from the Raphael Recanati International School. The Raphael
        Recanati International School is host to over 2500 Student from over 90
        countries. The school proudly proclaims itself as Zionists. Vice
        President for External Relations &amp; Head of the Raphael Recanati
        International School Mr. Jonathan Davis describes the Reichmann
        University in an interview with the Jerusalem Post titled” From lone
        soldier to university leader, Davis has shaped Reichman into a hub of
        Zionism, safety, and Jewish leadership.”:</p>
    <p>“In order to teach here, faculty members must teach in a Zionist
        atmosphere,” he says. “They can be left-wing Zionists, centrist
        Zionists, or right-wing Zionists. The common denominator of those
        different shades of Zionism is that each one of them is willing to
        sacrifice in defending the Jewish and democratic state from those who
        wish to destroy our country and everything we stand for.”</p>
    <p>The main goal of the RRIS is to spread its Zionists propaganda.</p>
    <p>“For Davis, calling means providing students with a “Zionist
        toolkit.” About half of the international students go on to make Aliyah,
        while the others return home with a transformed sense of self. “They’ve
        tasted Israeli democracy. They’ve seen freedom of speech, freedom of
        expression. They’ve experienced independence and responsibility,” he
        explains. “When they go back, they become automatic ambassadors for
        Israel, because they know the truth.””</p>
    <p>“Aliyah” is a key idea of Zionism. It is the Hebrew word for “ascent”
        and means the “return” of Jews to Israel.</p>
    <p>He furthermore describes the meaning of the school: “It’s seeing a
        student arrive here as a stranger, unsure of everything, and then
        flourish, completing their degree, serving in the IDF, starting a family
        here, or returning abroad to lead their community. That’s the true
        fulfilment of Zionism. We witness Zionism in action daily.”</p>

    <p>Connections to the IDF:</p>
    <p>Reichmann University has special scholarships for IDF reservists. It
        even provides guidance for students interested in joining the IDF. At
        the end of the school year there is a workshop for students interested
        in joining the IDF that is staffed by key IDF personnel. In an article
        he describes the schools attitude towards the IDF as follows “Reichman
        stands firmly behind its more than 4,000 reservists. “As a Zionist
        institution, we’ve always prioritized those who serve our country,”
        explains Davis. “We do everything we can to support them, from the
        admissions process, to awarding academic credit for elite IDF service,
        to flexible accommodations like extra classes and extended
        deadlines.”“</p>

    <p>Connections to the HHU</p>
    <p>The law faculty and the HHU has an exchange program with the
        Radzyner-Law-School. The HHU writes about their relations:</p>
    <p>“Die Juristische Fakultät Düsseldorf unterhält enge Kontakte zur
        Radzyner-Law-School, der ersten Fakultät der renommierten Reichman
        University in Herzliya in der Nähe von Tel Aviv. Dabei besteht sowohl
        die Möglichkeiten an gemeinsamen Seminaren und Vorträgen teilzunehmen,
        als auch für mehrere Wochen wechselseitig an den Universitäten zu
        hospitieren.</p>
    <p>Unter der Schirmherrschaft des nordrhein-westfälischen
        Ministerpräsidenten ist die Heinrich-Heine-Universität nunmehr
        Partneruniversität für den landesweiten Israelaustausch geworden, so
        dass sich die Beziehungen immer weiter verfestigen und interessierten
        Studierenden, aber auch Assistenten/innen und Dozenten/innen eine
        Möglichkeit gegeben wird, eine spannende Rechtsordnung und ein
        interessantes Land näher kennen zu lernen.“</p>
    <p>Additionally, there is an yearly German- Israel exchange seminar
        where law students from the HHU and Radzyner-Law-School discuss
        different law topics.</p>
    <h2 id="repressionen-hhu">Repression against Pro-Palestinian Students at HHU</h2>
    <p><strong>One-sided solidarity</strong><br />
        Within the last two and a half years HHU has continuously repressed
        pro-palestinian student initiatives.</p>
    <p>Shortly after the 7th October 2025 the rectorate set the tone by
        sending out an e-mail to all of the students and employees where they
        showed a one-sided focus on israeli and jewish victims. Palestinian
        victims were not recognised. The University only wrote about “numerous
        calls for violence against Jews and for demonstrations supporting
        Hamas”. Before there even was any political action on the campus of
        Düsseldorf, they ensured that every HHU affiliate knew they would
        sanction supposed acts of antisemitism and racism possibly with
        “criminal charges as well as deregistration and dismissal.”</p>
    <p>After that they put up a banner with the pictures of the israeli
        hostages. At the same time, there was no symbol of solidarity with the
        palestinian victims of the genocide in Gaza.</p>
    <p><strong>Protests on Campus</strong><br />
        The University also distanced itself from student led protests on
        campus. On 21th May 2024 the University sent out an official mail where
        they informed about a protest the next day from the student
        organisations SfP (Students for Palestine) and SDS (Socialist-democratic
        Studentunion). They explained that they could do nothing about the
        protest, because their authority does not apply to all areas of campus.
        They also implied a relation between the protest and antisemitism.<br />
        The University wrote two similar official E-Mails with regard to the
        protest camp in June 2024. They explained they had no authority over the
        campus, where the protest was going to be held (because it is a public
        space), but that the police will press charges against violence,
        insults, ani-semetic or racist symbols, and that the university would
        take further action in case the protest would spill over in the
        university buildings.</p>
    <p>Considering that the university has not send these kinds of mails
        with regard to other protests on campus we must assume a prejudgement of
        pro-palestinian actors</p>
    <p><strong>Prohibition of Student Events</strong></p>
    <p>HHU has repeatedly reacted repressively to discussion events
        organized by the student body. For example, a lecture entitled “What is
        the Nakba? The expulsion of Palestinians in the past and today,” which
        the SDS had planned for May 14, 2024, was effectively banned. After the
        event registration was initially approved, the SDS received an email on
        May 13, 2024, in which the university suddenly imposed conditions under
        which the event had to take place.<br />
        The SDS was informed that the event could only take place if the
        university’s conditions were met. The conditions included the exclusion
        of all external guests, the development of a security concept designed
        to prevent anti-Semitic and discriminatory statements, and the presence
        of a private security service, which the student organizers would have
        had to pay for themselves. Of course, there was no way to meet these
        conditions one day before the event.<br />
        In addition, HHU banned an exhibition commemorating Palestinian
        students. Students for Palestine had launched a petition calling on the
        university to supplement the banner of Israeli hostages with a banner
        featuring Palestinian victims. In a personal conversation with the
        rector, Prof. Dr. Anja Steinbeck, the request of Students for Palestine
        was rejected. However, during the conversation the idea for a memorial
        exhibition for murdered Palestinian students came up, which was
        “encouraged” by the rector. Students for Palestine therefore designed
        such an exhibition, which was to take place in the foyer of the
        University and State Library (ULB). When they sent their concept to the
        university management by email, however, the exhibition was rejected in
        harsh tones by Martin Goch.</p>
    <p>After Martin Goch received the exhibition proposal by email, he
        consulted with the Ministry of Culture and the rector, who was on
        vacation at the time. Everyone agreed that the event should be banned.
        In the email received by Students for Palestine, Martin Goch justified
        the ban by stating that the exhibition “posed a significant risk to
        safety and order on campus” and would “massively impair the proper
        functioning of study and teaching.” According to its own statement, the
        university had come to this assessment “after weighing all aspects with
        the help of expert opinions.” An inquiry by Students for Palestine to
        “Frag den Staat” (Ask the State) revealed the internal communication.
        This shows that no experts were consulted, only the Ministry of Culture.
        However, the ministry only confirmed that the university’s decision
        would receive public attention. Therefore, special attention should be
        paid to the reasons for the ban. “Security and order on campus as well
        as the functioning of teaching and administration should be taken into
        account.”<br />
        This is clearly not an assessment of the safety and functionality of
        teaching, but rather a consultation regarding PR strategy.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, internal communications also show that, as a result of
        this exhibition, the rector suggested “tightening the rules again for
        the next semester […] otherwise we will spend the entire semester
        assessing annoying individual cases because each side will try to push
        us around.” Some time later, the university did indeed introduce a new
        document on event registration. The following three questions were added
        to the old document:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>“8. Will the event address a political topic that has been
                controversial in the past?</p>
            <p>- Yes/No</p>
            <p>If yes, what topic and why could it be considered
                controversial?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>“10. Information about external speakers:<br />
                <em>(Only to be completed for speakers who are not members or affiliates

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In November 2024, following the ban on the Nakba lecture and
        commemorative exhibition, the SDS and SfP published an open letter
        calling for critical discourse and an end to event bans at HHU. Despite
        more than 500 signatures from the student body, HHU never publicly
        responded to this letter.</p>
    <p>Instead, they banned another event entitled “War in Gaza: What
        Germany is (not) doing,” which was to take place on November 19, 2024.
        The ban was justified on the grounds that, after reviewing the speakers,
        the university feared that “anti-Semitic statements” might be made. This
        was surprising because the speakers were two members of the SDS who had
        not previously spoken publicly on the subject.</p>
    <p>However, during a Senate meeting, it emerged that the speakers listed
        on the form had not been vetted. Instead, reference was made to<br />
        speakers listed on an outdated poster that had been published before the
        application was submitted. These were Lena Obermeier and Michael Sappir,
        who produce the podcast “Parallelwelt Palästina” (Parallel World
        Palestine). This meant that an Israeli Jew had been accused of
        anti-Semitism.</p>
    <p>In October 2025, an event entitled “The Origins of the Conflict
        between Israel and Palestine” was held. The university did not issue a
        ban, but demanded that admission be restricted to members of the
        HHU.</p>
    <p>[es bräuchte noch ein Abschlussstatement]</p>
    <h2 id="sanctions-against-russia">Sanctions against Russia by the HHU</h2>
    <p>The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) announced their decision
        to restrict German-Russian exchange relations on February 25, 2022. The
        institution terminated all applications for Russian scholarships,
        cancelled scholarships to Russia, and froze financial support for German
        students, who are already receiving funding for their academic stay in
        Russia. The president Joybrato Mukherjee justifies this decision by
        commenting that “in the view of war, we believe it is imperative to
        critically review the promotion of exchange relations with Russia” (DAAD
        2022). The DAAD’s announcement included the expectation for all German
        universities to suspend their DAAD-funded project activities with
        partner institutions in Russia as well as Belarus.</p>
    <p>The German Rector’s Conference (HRK) declared one day earlier, that
        they will explore their options regarding the academic relations between
        Germany, Russia and Ukraine in cooperation with German academic
        organisations – such as the DAAD – as well as in consultation with the
        German Federal Government. Simultaneously, they announced their
        solidarity with Ukraine and concern for the well-being of Ukrainian
        scholars and students. Furthermore, they proclaim the assist as well as
        aid of German universities for Ukrainian academics within the scope of
        their abilities (HRK 2022).</p>
    <p>On the 28th of February, 2022, the HHU announces their solidarity
        with the people of Ukraine and promises aid. Furthermore, they proclaim
        their full endorsement and agreement with the statements issued by the
        DAAD and HRK (HHU 2022a). The HHU hereby declares to terminate all
        academic relations with Russia and Belarus that are DAAD-funded. This
        meant suspending their future and ongoing student exchange programs, its
        strategic and academic partnership with the Russian and Belarusian
        universities, such as the Financial University in Moscow (HHU 2021).
        Furthermore, on the 23rd of March, 2022, the HHU opened a solidary aid
        programme for scholars and students from Ukraine, including
        scholarships, mentoring, language courses, and a trilingual information
        website with links for aid programmes at HHU and elsewhere (HHU
        2022b).</p>
    <p>At the beginning of March, the HHU published an interview with
        Prof. Dr. Beate Fieseler about the war in Ukraine, declaring it
        imperialistic as well as reversionistic. They discuss the role of the
        Russian media as a propaganda and indoctrination organ for the Russian
        people, and denote Putin’s statement that Ukraine is committing Genocide
        on its Russian population as a lie. Putin is describes as dictatorial as
        well as power-hungry, and Ukraine’s civilian population – instead of
        military or other significant institutions – is identified as the goal
        of his attacks. Prof. Dr. Fieseler uses the phrase: “Hier soll ein Staat
        mit seiner ganzen Bevölkerung niedergerungen werden” (Here, a state with
        its whole population is meant to be destroyed) to describe Putin’s
        actions (HHU 2022c). With this interview, the HHU takes a critical
        stance towards Russia’s attacks, opposes their opinions, and declares
        its solidarity with Ukraine and its civilians.</p>
    <p>In August 2022, the HHU strengthens its relations to Ukraine by
        signing an official, long-term partnership with the Chernivtsi
        University, showing continued solidarity and support for Ukraine and its
        scholars by providing “more concrete assistance and establish[ing]
        direct scientific relations” (HHU 2022d).</p>
    <p>In 2024, HHU publishes their guidelines for academic relations and
        contacts with Russia and Belarus. The aim is that scientific
        cooperations should not strengthen the reputation and power-instruments
        of the current governments in Russia and Belarus. Individuals contacts
        and encounters will be maintained, especially those reinforcing the
        opposition in Russia and Belarus. The guidelines declare that all
        official cooperations will be reviewed and – if necessary – revised with
        the possibility of termination. New cooperation agreements are precluded
        for now, and any collaborations of HHU-members with Bela(russian)
        scientists and scholars, who openly issue statements of pro-Russian
        government content, are terminated. Furthermore, no business trips and
        all mobility to Russia and Belarus is barred, and no jointly events or
        functions with Bela(russian) scientific institutions are permitted.
        Lastly, all financial support is discontinued (HHU 2024).</p>
    <p>These actions undertaken by the HHU by severing ties and connection
        with Bela(russian) educational and academic institutions set a precedent
        for the university. The HHU has proven prior experience in the
        bureaucratic as well as administrative aspects of participating in
        academic boycott.</p>

    <h2 id="demands">Demands</h2>
    As a result of the situation described in this report these following
    demands are necessary to ensure academic neutrality and freedom.<br />
    First we demand an official Statement recognising the Israeli offence on
    Palestinian land as a genocide. This statement must include a
    declaration of solidarity with the Palestinian people.<br />
    We call for an end of all affiliations with Israeli universities and
    therefore with the Israeli military. The report lists cooperations
    between HHU and Israeli institutions, most of which work directly with
    the Israeli military (IDF). These Partnerships do not only condone but
    also fund the genocide happening in Gaza right now. We especially want
    to point out the collaborations with the Reichmann and Tel Aviv
    University. We do not call for a boycott of individual people but of
    institutions that make the genocide possible.<br />
    We demand the end of all repression against students and personnel
    educating on and protesting for Palestine. As described above meetings
    regarding the topic of Palestinian History and resistance have been
    suddenly cancelled by HU authority. The leaked chats with the head of
    the HHU show these cancellations only happened because repression
    against the anti-genocide movement and had no actual cause.<br />
    Following the publication of this report we expect the head of HHU to
    act on our demands and take responsibility for their current genocide
    supporting stand.</p>

    Geklaut vom FU Berlin report
    <h3> Apendix 1: Precedence of other European Universities</h3>
    <p>Several European universities have taken steps to sever ties with
        Israeli institutions involved in military research or located in illegal
        settlements, in order to comply with international humanitarian Law. The
        FU would not be an exceptional case in Europe for taking such measures,
